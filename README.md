## Core Python Concepts

- Understanding of Python data types: `int`, `float`, `string`, `list`, `tuple`, `dictionary`, `set`.
- Variables, data structures, and operators.
- Control flow: `if-else` statements, loops (`for` and `while`), and switch-case alternatives.
- Functions: defining, calling, parameters, return values, and scoping.
- Exception handling: `try-except` blocks, handling specific exceptions.
- List comprehensions and generators.
- Decorators and context managers.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and objects: creating classes, instantiating objects.
- Inheritance, composition, and polymorphism.
- Method overriding and `super()`.
- Magic methods (dunder methods).
- Class attributes and instance attributes.
- Abstraction, encapsulation, and SOLID principles.

## Advanced Python Concepts

- Iterators and iterables.
- Generators and coroutines.
- Context managers using the `with` statement.
- Threading and multiprocessing.
- Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
- Memory management: reference counting, garbage collection.
- Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

## Python Modules and Libraries

- Standard library modules: `os`, `sys`, `math`, `datetime`, etc.
- Working with files and directories.
- Regular expressions (`re` module).
- Serialization: JSON, Pickle, and CSV.
- Virtual environments and package management with `pip`.
- Third-party libraries: `requests`, `NumPy`, `pandas`.

## Web Development

- Basics of HTTP and RESTful APIs.
- Flask or Django framework: setting up a basic app, routing, templates.
- Handling requests and responses.
- Authentication and authorization.
- Working with databases: SQLAlchemy, ORMs.

## Testing and Debugging

- Unit testing using `unittest` or `pytest`.
- Test-driven development (TDD) principles.
- Debugging techniques: print statements, logging, and debugging tools.
- Profiling and optimizing Python code.

## Version Control

- Git fundamentals: cloning, branching, merging, and rebasing.
- Using Git for collaborative development.
- Understanding and resolving merge conflicts.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

- Basic algorithmic complexity analysis (big O notation).
- Common data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables.
- Sorting and searching algorithms: bubble sort, quicksort, binary search, etc.

## Design Patterns

- Understanding and implementing common design patterns.
- Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
- Applying design patterns to real-world scenarios.

## SQL and Databases

- Basics of SQL: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements.
- Relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- Database design and normalization.
- Understanding ORMs and their usage.

Remember that while studying these topics, it's important to practice with coding exercises, projects, and real-world examples to solidify your understanding. Good luck with your interviews!
